This is a basic CRUD project designed for people to be able to log in a create and post recipies. 

Diving into this project I hoped to gain knowledge about backend web development and where it fits into a final project, but I ended up learning so much more. I learned how to use a NoSQL database MongoDB, Docker for containerization, and basic knowledge of deployment, troubleshooting CORS issues, as well as improving my knowledge of react with hooks and contexts. Additionally, I learned about JSON web tokens and BCrypt to hash and encrypt passwords to create a secure login/signup process.
